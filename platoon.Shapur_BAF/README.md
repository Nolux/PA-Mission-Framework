#PA-Mission-Framework#
#====================#

This is the PA version of the Folk ARPS F3 framework.
It is currently being heavily modified.
A folder with one standard platoon structure is available.
Added many more markers to accomodate CAS, ARMOR, MEDEVAC and WEAPONS teams.

This file will eventually contain a list of files that need editing for each mission,
in order to set the mission information and other conditional settings.
Later a guideline to how to set up these things will be included to work towards a 
unified PA style.

For now this is the first step.
