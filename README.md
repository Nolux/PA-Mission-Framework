#PA-Mission-Framework#
#====================#

This is the PA version of the Folk ARPS F3 framework.
At the moment it will be heavily stripped down.
Folder will be included for different unit loadouts in different settings.
And maybe eventually ready made platoons that you can copy into the mission.sqm file.

This file will eventually contain a list of files that need editing for each mission,
in order to set the mission information and other conditional settings.
Later a guideline to how to set up these things will be included to work towards a 
unified PA style.

For now this is the first step.
